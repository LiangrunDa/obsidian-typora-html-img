# Obsidian Typora HTML Image 

This plugin allows you to use the Typora HTML image syntax in Obsidian. It converts the relative path to the image to the correct path in Obsidian.

This project is inspired by [obsidian-local-img-plugin](https://github.com/talengu/obsidian-local-img-plugin/tree/master) with bugs fixed and Live Preview mode in iOS supported.
